# Spiral-Wave-Pygame
A simulation in pygame of a spiral wave. Inspired by participation in the Dynamics of Excitable Systems Workshop 
held at the Rochester Institute of Technolgy.

Written with Pygame for Python 2.7 (older version used due to pygame compatibility and convinience as I already 
had 2.7 downloaded). Consists of 2 files (main and class containing file)

If downloaded to try, the proper versions of pygame and python must be installed. Board is customizable and so 
are the dynamics of the system and the pertubations.
